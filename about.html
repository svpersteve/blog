When coaching, I adopt a student-focused approach to learning that's built on encouraging choice and autonomy, highly rewarding environments that engage the brain for learning and encourage behaviours that offer the student the best opportunity to shine in their own unique way.</p> <h3> <i class='fa fa-star'></i> Behaviour </h3> <p>I believe all people, adults and children, are innately good, and any disruptive behaviours have a reason behind them. The key to resolving disruptive behaviours is to identify and work on that reason, rather than reacting to the behaviour itself. A proactive approach is always more effective than a reactive one.</p> <h3> <i class='fa fa-star'></i> Achievement </h3> <p>I believe good habits are the key to success, and if we focus our will power on adopting good habits through the use of cues and rewards, then activities gradually require less willpower to complete. I use daily goals to help me make good habits as a motivational tool that guides me in the direction I want to head in. It’s important to choose your own goals so you feel in control, and the sense of achievement when you accomplish those goals motivates you. I use this approach with myself and for coaching others.</p> </div> <div class=m-page__section> <h3>April 2018 - Present</h3> <div class=center> <a href='http://happybearsoftware.com' target=_blank> <img alt='Happy Bear Software logo' class=m-page__image src='../img/hb.png'> </a> </div> <p>Happy Bear Software is a technical consultancy by <a href='https://najafali.com/' target=__blank>Najaf Ali</a> that helps businesses build better custom software on the web.

This, I hadn't realised at the time, dropped me in at the deepend by forcing me to take the TV and radio units I had strategically avoided the previous year, but forgotten about.</p> <p>My confidence was growing, but I was still too shy to be a public speaker. I panicked and withdrew, fleeing to the safety of a teaching assistant position at Mandeville before transferring to the Open University.</p> <p>I took the following units at City:</p> <ul> <li> <i class='fa fa-graduation-cap'></i> Level 1: Introduction to Journalism </li> <li> <i class='fa fa-graduation-cap'></i> Level 1: History of Journalism </li> <li> <i class='fa fa-graduation-cap'></i> Level 1: Introduction to Sociology </li> <li> <i class='fa fa-graduation-cap'></i> Level 1: Understanding the Modern World </li> </ul> </div> <div class=m-page__section> <h1>Past Experience</h1> <h3>January - May 2016</h3> <div class=center> <a href='http://www.tolworthgirlsschool.co.uk/' target=_blank> <img alt='Tolworth Girls School' class=m-page__image src='../img/tolworth.png'> </a> </div> <p>I had a wonderful opportunity to empower young future leaders at Tolworth Girls School while working with pupils with Specific</p> Language Impairment. The transition from primary special needs to mainstream secondary was terrifying, but that's why I did it, and my apprehension was unnecessary. <p>Tolworth inspired my curiosity for public speaking after I agreed to give a talk on a book I had read to a class of 30 year 7 girls. The girls had so many questions and one of them enthusiastically borrowed the book from the library straight after my talk. The joy of inspiring a young person to read is indiscribable.</p> </div> <div class=m-page__section> <h3>October 2012 - April 2015</h3> <div class=center> <a href='http://mandeville.ealing.sch.uk' target=_blank> <img alt='Mandeville School' class=m-page__image src='../img/mandeville.png'> </a> </div> <p>Three of the best years of my life were spent working with truly inspiring children and their families. I supported a class teacher in directly teaching two children with Autism Spectrum Condition. This involved planning and delivering individual and whole class lessons, specialising in IT and speech and language therapy.</p> <p>Working with children with challenging behaviour has given me confidence to deal with conflict, and combined with my degree, a deeper understanding of human behaviour.</p> </div> </div> </div> </section> <footer> <div class=a-social-icons> <a href='https://twitter.com/svpersteve' target=_blank> <i class='fa fa-twitter'></i> </a> <a href='https://linkedin.com/in/svpersteve' target=_blank> <i class='fa fa-linkedin'></i> </a> <a href='https://github.com/svpersteve' target=_blank> <i class='fa fa-github'></i> </a> <a href='https://instagram.com/svpersteve' target=_blank> <i class='fa fa-instagram'></i> </a> <a href='mailto:steve.v.brewer@gmail.com?subject=Enquiry' target=_blank> <i class='fa fa-envelope'></i> </a> <a href='/feed.xml' target=_blank> <i class='fa fa-rss'></i> </a> </div> <p> <i class='fa fa-copyright'></i> Steve Brewer 2018 </p> </footer> <script src='https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.0/jquery.min.js'></script> <script src='/javascripts/application.js'></script> </body> </html>
