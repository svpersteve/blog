I hope reading my experience will help them understand there are ways out, and that it’s possible to transform pain into love and empathy rather than anger and aggression.</p> <p>When I was 15, my sister told my parents I was gay while they visited her in London. The first conversation we had when she got home went like this: “Debby tells me you think you’re gay?”</p> <p>“What do you mean think?”. If she hadn’t emphasised ‘think’ so hard I may not have noticed where she was going with this right away.</p> <p>“Yes. Well I don’t believe you are gay.”</p> <p>She’d called the homophobic pastor at her church for crisis-management advice and he’d told her if she just kept me away from this ‘lifestyle’ - cut me off from the internet, take my phone and keep an eye on what I do, I’ll return to ‘normal’. She clung hard to the false hope that lie gave her, and did all those things.</p> <p>When I wanted to know how long it would be like this for, she said, “Until we can trust you again.” I didn’t know what it meant at the time, but I sure felt it:</p> <blockquote> <p>I didn’t belong with my family anymore, and that felt like falling into a deep, black void.</p> </blockquote> <p>I couldn’t separate her loathing of my sexual orientation from a loathing of me. As far as I knew my parents hated me, and I disgusted them.</p> <p>What she meant was they’d lost trust in me to ‘behave’. What I had done wrong was read about being gay on the Internet (and <a href="http://www.bgiok.org.uk/">how it’s ok</a>), chat to strangers in gay chat rooms, and look at gay porn.</p> <p>None of this harmed me. Whether or not a 15 year old should be consuming porn is a separate issue. Her fear and anger centred around the fact I was being gay and she wanted it to stop.</p> <p>I set my alarm for 5:30am the next day and was out the door by 6am on a bus to the nearest city. I had no plan, I was just desperate to get away from the pain and rejection by my most primal of all our social groups. Nothing mattered anymore, I just needed to be anywhere else.</p> <p>I don’t remember where I went, but I was back by the end of the day. I went back to school the next day and followed the new rules. I sat away from my friends out of shame, even though they didn’t know anything about this, I was certain they didn’t want me with them.</p> <p>It stayed that way for my last year of school. I played video games in my room, checked out of school and my family got to know me as a “bone idle” drifter with no future. Neither of us understood this was depression, how deep it was or their part in causing it and staying silent instead of using their words to fix it.</p> <p>About a year of this approach didn’t change my sexual orientation, and I was losing the will to live. I had a job and eventually bought a phone, and had access to the internet again. I started chatting to gay men online. This, as seedy as it still sounds, saved me.</p> <p>I made friends who challenged what my parents had told me. I felt human connection again, I felt valued and that I belonged somewhere, even if it was with other “perverts” who “would say these things, they’re gay”.</p> <p>One of those friends was vacating a room in Southampton I could just about afford on a kitchen porter wage, so I took it and left home. I was 16 and not ready for this, but I learned how to make difficult choices and I soon got ready.</p> <p>At this point my mum let go. She was in over her head with this plan her pastor had put her on and was now afraid I wouldn’t survive, and she was right to given the suicide rates for LGBT people. She wasn’t equipped to be vulnerable and talk to me openly, or listen to how I felt, but the anger stopped and she helped me move.</p> <p>The difference I felt the moment I was on my own was overwhelming. I belonged again, even if it was only to myself. I wasn’t an intruder in my own home anymore, and I could finally stop looking over my shoulder.</p> <p>I stopped being messy and lazy literally the same day. I was suddenly full of energy and motivation to take care of myself, feed myself, keep my room neat and go out and meet new people. I dressed better, I showered daily (I know) and I applied for college.</p> <p>I love my parents very much, and we’re in a better place now, but it’s taken a long time and we’ve lost a lot of years of connection.</p> <p>4 years later I gave her <a href="http://amzn.to/2tUsBim">Prayers for Bobby</a>, a film with a similar story to our own that was powerful enough to reach my mum and change her.</p> <iframe width=560 height=315 src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8SW0W7L4vRc" frameborder=0 allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> <p>She apologised and finally began to listen.</p> <p>Brene Brown talks about the damage family rejection can cause in <a href="http://amzn.to/2Iz2YqH">Braving the Wilderness</a>, “Even in the context of suffering—poverty, violence, human rights violations—not belonging in our families is still one of the most dangerous hurts. That’s because it has the power to break our heart, our spirit, and our sense of self-worth.”</p> <p>It broke all of those for me.</p> <p>She describes three outcomes:</p> <ol> <li>You live in constant pain and seek relief by numbing it and/ or inflicting it on others;</li> <li>You deny your pain, and your denial ensures that you pass it on to those around you and down to your children; or</li> <li>You find the courage to own the pain and develop a level of empathy and compassion for yourself and others that allows you to spot hurt in the world in a unique way.</li> </ol> <p>I’ve engaged in the first and second outcomes. I’ve spiralled into debt, thrown myself into relationships with toxic men, dropped out of college several times and even today I still tell myself I’m fine when sometimes I’m not.</p> <p>I’ve always used denial to help me wait patiently for pain to go away. I also use denial to help me take risks and be vulnerable without letting fear stop me. This, and the many positive and supportive people I’ve met has kept me more and more often in the third outcome.</p> <p>Supportive social circles where we belong can lift us up. But these are medication, not a cure. They bring you back to life, but you still have to figure out how to belong nowhere and everywhere, or that social circle becomes an echo chamber.</p> <p>Brene talks about adopting a “strong back, soft front” when challenging ideas. Use empathy, not bubble-backed anger and over-confidence in your own opinion because others agree with it. When we have that circle of people, on or offline, who agree with us we can feel “right” and unstoppable, and if we apply enough force we can bring the rest of the world to our way of thinking.</p> <p>That would sure make us feel we belonged everywhere, but that’s unattainable, and unnecessary. All we’re doing is robbing people of the sense of belonging they get from their own bubble of opposite views.</p> <p>If we can’t let go of the need to belong to more than ourselves, we need to at least detach our opinions and beliefs from our sense of belonging. If someone says something that angers you, ripping them a new one will make them cling harder to their beliefs and connection with the people who agree with them, because you threatened their sense of belonging.</p> <p>Those people still belong to you, treat them that way and they’re more likely to listen to you.</p> <footer> <div class=a-social-icons> <a href='https://twitter.com/svpersteve' target=_blank> <i class='fa fa-twitter'></i> </a> <a href='https://linkedin.com/in/svpersteve' target=_blank> <i class='fa fa-linkedin'></i> </a> <a href='https://github.com/svpersteve' target=_blank> <i class='fa fa-github'></i> </a> <a href='https://instagram.com/svpersteve' target=_blank> <i class='fa fa-instagram'></i> </a> <a href='mailto:steve.v.brewer@gmail.com?subject=Enquiry' target=_blank> <i class='fa fa-envelope'></i> </a> <a href='/feed.xml' target=_blank> <i class='fa fa-rss'></i> </a> </div> <p> <i class='fa fa-copyright'></i> Steve Brewer 2018 </p> </footer> <script src='https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.0/jquery.min.js'></script> <script src='/javascripts/application.js'></script> </body> </html>
