So today I had the pleasure of reading four pages of what my peers had to say about me. <code>Spoiler: It's joyous!</code> üòÑü¶Ñ</p> <p>Here are my ‚ù§Ô∏è faves:</p> <blockquote> <p>Steve's been great to work with and there's burgeoning potential there; I can see him going a long, long way with the skills he's got.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>It's incredibly refreshing to have someone so exuberant, excitable, and keen in the company. Like, wow.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Steve shouldn't hesitate to step up and offer direction for the team. He seems to be a very good leader that people warm to and trust. It‚Äôs not that he doesn‚Äôt do this already, it‚Äôs just I think he should feel comfortable in doing more of it.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>He has quickly turned into a leading light for the team, helping us improve our processes, focus on our sprint goals and, of course, experiment with new tools (cough trello).</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Steve‚Äôs one of those people whose productivity is infectious and I feel our team has been more productive and engaged since he joined.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>I was surprised to learn that this is his first development role as his professionalism, proactivity, speed of delivery and eagerness to learn are all qualities I‚Äôd normally expect of a more senior developer.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>He‚Äôs a pleasure to work with and has made our team feel more driven, more fun, and more organised.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Encouraging and supporting the team move to trello so soon after joining shows confidence in his own skills and knowledge, and a knack for problem solving‚Ä¶</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>‚Ä¶plus that was a very good learning hour; he's a very good teacher and will be a great asset to the team‚Ä¶</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>‚Ä¶and it was impressive to write <a href="https://about.futurelearn.com/blog/learning-to-love-trello/">a blog post</a> about it too!</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Steve has not only been great at making suggestions about improvements we can make to the product and how we work as a team, but crucially he‚Äôs also been great at making sure that those things actually happen!</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Steve is always keen to help others inside and outside the team and to share what he‚Äôs learnt with others. His Trello learning hour was a great success, but he‚Äôs also been very good at updating the wiki and other documentation when he‚Äôs found gaps.</p> </blockquote> </div> <div id=disqus_thread></div> <script>
